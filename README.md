Pomodoromine
============

A qt redmine pomodoro client that allows the user to work on redmine issues with [The Pomodoro Technique](http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/).

Issues can be added to todays schedule by setting the status to "In Progress" and assigning the right person.
Every half an hour counts as one pomodoro, so it works with every redmine instance. All you need to do is add your domain and your api key.

* Sounds
* Basic statistics (pomodoros done, pomodoros left)
* Systemtray indicates status of current pomodoro
* Basic redmine features (show some issue information, issue creation, mark "Done", open in browser)
